# STM32L476 Debugging - Adding breakpoints, checking real-time values while stepping into functions. Checking register values from SFRs.
# STM32L476 -SWV Sends characters by using Serial Wire Viewer set-up on Core Clock : 80 MHz , SWO Clock : 2000 kHZ , Port : 0 . The elements are sent by _write_swv function which take the characters and its lenght. During the process the variables expressions are followed up like (len, ptr - memory location , *ptr - char value passed for every single iteration.
